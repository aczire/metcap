<h1>Install - METCAP Driver Installer</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><b>install</b> is a Win32 console application that is designed 
specifically to install and uninstall the WDK METCAP NDIS protocol driver. It is loosely based on the
<b>SNetCfg</b> application from the 
Windows 2000 DDK.</p>
<p>The application is designed to be called from a Windows Command Prompt window 
or from a Windows Installer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Building the Application</h2>
<p>The application is built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.</p>
<p>Building the application does depend on additional header files from the DDK. 
You will have to adjust the project's &quot;Additional Include Directories&quot; property 
to point to your DDK install folders:</p>
<p>Strings defined in the install.H header file are used to select the driver's 
INF files, PnP IDs and Friendly Name. So, once built the application can only be 
used to install the WDK METCAP driver. However, since source code to 
<b>install</b> is available you may make modifications to suit your own needs.</p>
<h2>Installing and Uninstalling the Driver using install</h2>
<p>As written <b>install</b> must be run from a folder that also contains the 
METCAP driver package, which includes the driver executable, INF and CAT 
files.</p>
<p>To install METCAP the install folder 
would contain these items:</p>
<ul>
	<li>install.EXE</li>
	<li>METCAP.SYS</li>
	<li>METCAP.INF</li>
	<li>METCAP.CAT</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installing the Driver</h3>
<p>To install the driver run the <b>install</b> application with the /Install 
command-line switch:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New">install /Install</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Uninstalling the Driver</h3>
<p>To uninstall the driver run the <b>install</b> application with the /Uninstall 
command-line switch:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New">install /Uninstall</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hiding the Command Window</h3>
<p>In some cases it may be desirable to hide the <b>install</b> command window from 
view. This may be particularly desirable when using <b>install</b> in conjunction with 
a Windows Installer. To hide the <b>install</b> window append the /Hide 
command-line switch after the /Install or /Uninstall switch. </p>
<p>Here is an example command-line that hides the <b>install</b> window during 
installation:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New">install /Install /hide</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Using install in a Windows Installer</h3>
<p>Use the Windows Installer Custom Actions feature to call install.EXE.</p>
<p>For example, to call <b>install</b> to install the driver, add a new &quot;Install 
Driver&quot; action to the pre-defined Install action. The Install Driver <i><b>Arguments</b></i> 
property would be /Install and the <i><b>SourcePath</b></i> property would be the path to the 
install.exe file on the development computer.</p>
<p>To call <b>install</b> to uninstall the driver, add a new &quot;Uninstall Driver&quot; action 
to the pre-defined Uninstall action. The Uninstall Driver <i><b>Arguments</b></i> property 
would be /Uninstall and the <i><b>SourcePath</b></i> property would be the path to the 
install.exe file on the development computer.</p>
